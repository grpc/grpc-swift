/// - Parameters:
///   - host: The host to bind the server socket to, defaults to "localhost".
///   - port: The port to bind the server socket to.
///   - eventLoopGroup: Event loop group to run the server on.
///   - serviceProviders: Service providers to handle requests with, defaults to provider for the
///     "Test" service.
///   - useTLS: Whether to use TLS or not. If `true` then the server will use the "server1"
///     certificate and CA as set out in the interoperability test specification. The common name
///     is "*.test.google.fr"; clients should set their hostname override accordingly.
/// - Returns: A future `Server` configured to serve the test service.
