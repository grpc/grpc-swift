/// Server features which may be required for tests.

/// We use this enum to match up tests we can run on the NIO client against the NIO server at
/// run time.
///
/// These features are listed in the [gRPC interoperability test description
/// specification](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/interop-test-descriptions.md).
///
/// Missing features:
/// - compressed response
/// - compressed request
/// - observe `ResponseParameter.interval_us`
/// - echo authenticated username
/// - echo authenticated OAuth scope
///
/// - Note: This is not a complete set of features, only those used in either the client or server.

  /// When the client sets expect_compressed to true, the server expects the client request to be
  /// compressed. If it's not, it fails the RPC with INVALID_ARGUMENT. Note that
  /// `response_compressed` is present on both SimpleRequest (unary) and StreamingOutputCallRequest
  /// (streaming).

  /// with the status code and messsage contained within said `responseStatus`. The server will not
  /// process any further messages on the stream sent by the client. This can be used by clients to
  /// verify correct handling of different status codes and associated status messages end-to-end.
