/// A `ChannelHandler` which manages the lifecycle of a gRPC connection over HTTP/2.
///
/// This handler is responsible for managing several aspects of the connection. These include:
/// 1. Handling the graceful close of connections. When gracefully closing a connection the server
///    sends a GOAWAY frame with the last stream ID set to the maximum stream ID allowed followed by
///    a PING frame. On receipt of the PING frame the server sends another GOAWAY frame with the
///    highest ID of all streams which have been opened. After this, the handler closes the
///    connection once all streams are closed.
/// 2. Enforcing that graceful shutdown doesn't exceed a configured limit (if configured).
/// 3. Gracefully closing the connection once it reaches the maximum configured age (if configured).
/// 4. Gracefully closing the connection once it has been idle for a given period of time (if
///    configured).
/// 5. Periodically sending keep alive pings to the client (if configured) and closing the
///    connection if necessary.
/// 6. Policing pings sent by the client to ensure that the client isn't misconfigured to send
///    too many pings.
///
/// Some of the behaviours are described in:
/// - [gRFC A8](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A8-client-side-keepalive.md), and
/// - [gRFC A9](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A9-server-side-conn-mgt.md).
