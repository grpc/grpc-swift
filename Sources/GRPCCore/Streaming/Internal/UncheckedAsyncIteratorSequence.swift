  // of a single async sequence.

  // However, gRPC needs to read the first message in a sequence of inbound request/response parts
  // to check how the RPC should be handled. To do this it creates an async iterator and waits for
  // the first value and then decides what to do. If it continues processing the RPC it uses this
  // wrapper type to turn the iterator back into an async sequence and then drops the iterator on
  // the floor so that there is only a single consumer of the original source.
