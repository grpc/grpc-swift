// Tail allocate both the mutex and a generic value using ManagedBuffer.
// Both the header pointer and the elements pointer are stable for
// the class's entire lifetime.
//
// However, for safety reasons, we elect to place the lock in the "elements"
// section of the buffer instead of the head. The reasoning here is subtle,
// so buckle in.
//
// _As a practical matter_, the implementation of ManagedBuffer ensures that
// the pointer to the header is stable across the lifetime of the class, and so
// each time you call `withUnsafeMutablePointers` or `withUnsafeMutablePointerToHeader`
// the value of the header pointer will be the same. This is because ManagedBuffer uses
// `Builtin.addressOf` to load the value of the header, and that does ~magic~ to ensure
// that it does not invoke any weird Swift accessors that might copy the value.
//
// _However_, the header is also available via the `.header` field on the ManagedBuffer.
// This presents a problem! The reason there's an issue is that `Builtin.addressOf` and friends
// do not interact with Swift's exclusivity model. That is, the various `with` functions do not
// conceptually trigger a mutating access to `.header`. For elements this isn't a concern because
// there's literally no other way to perform the access, but for `.header` it's entirely possible
// to accidentally recursively read it.
//
// Our implementation is free from these issues, so we don't _really_ need to worry about it.
// However, out of an abundance of caution, we store the Value in the header, and the LockPrimitive
// in the trailing elements. We still don't use `.header`, but it's better to be safe than sorry,
// and future maintainers will be happier that we were cautious.
