# Design

This article provides a high-level overview of the design of gRPC Swift.

The library is split into three broad layers:
1. Transport,
2. Call, and
3. Stub.

The _transport_ layer provides (typically) long-lived bidirectional
communication between two peers and provides streams of request and response
parts. On top of the transport is the _call_ layer which is responsible for
mapping a call onto a stream and dealing with serialization. The highest level
of abstraction is the _stub_ layer which provides client and server interfaces
generated from an interface definition language (IDL).

## Overview

### Transport

The transport layer provides a bidirectional communication channel with a remote
peer which is typically long-lived.

Transports have two main interfaces:
1. Streams, used by the call layer.
2. The transport specific communication with its corresponding remote peer.

The most common transport in gRPC is HTTP/2. However others such as gRPC-Web,
HTTP/3 and in-process also exist. (gRPC Swift has transports for HTTP/2 built on
top of Swift NIO and also provides an in-process transport.)

You shouldn't think of a transport as a single connection, they're more
abstract. For example, a transport may maintain a set of connections to a
collection of remote endpoints which change over time. By extension, client
transports are also responsible for balancing load across multiple connections
where applicable.

Each peer (client and server) has their own transport protocol, in gRPC Swift
these are:
1. ``ServerTransport``, and
2. ``ClientTransport``.

The vast majority of users won't need to implement either of these protocols.
However, many users will need to create instances of types conforming to these
protocols to create a server or client, respectively.

#### Server transport

The ``ServerTransport`` is responsible for the server half of a transport. It
listens for new gRPC streams and then processes them. This is achieved via the
``ServerTransport/listen(streamHandler:)`` requirement.

A handler is passed into the `listen` method which is provided by the gRPC
server. It's responsible for routing and handling the stream. The stream is
executed in the context of the server transport – that is, the `listen` method
is an ancestor task of all RPCs handled by the server.

Note that the server transport doesn't include the idea of a "connection". While
an HTTP/2 server transport will in all likelihood have multiple connections open
at any given time, that detail isn't surfaced at this level of abstraction.

#### Client transport

While the server is responsible for handling streams, the ``ClientTransport`` is
responsible for creating them. Client transports will typically maintain a
number of connections which may change over a period of time. Maintaining these
connections and other background work is done in the ``ClientTransport/connect()``
method. Cancelling the task running this method will result in the transport
abruptly closing. The transport can be shutdown gracefully by calling
``ClientTransport/beginGracefulShutdown()``.

Streams are created using ``ClientTransport/withStream(descriptor:options:_:)``
and the lifetime of the stream is limited to the closure. The handler passed to
the method will be provided by a gRPC client and will ultimately include the
caller's code to send request messages and process response messages. Cancelling
the task abruptly closes the stream, although the transport should ensure that
doing this doesn't leave the other side waiting indefinitely.

gRPC has mechanisms to deliver method-specific configuration at the transport
layer which can also change dynamically (see [gRFC A2: ServiceConfig in
DNS](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/0e1807a6e30a1a915c0dcadc873bca92b9fa9720/A2-service-configs-in-dns.md).)
This configuration is used to determine how clients should interact with servers
and how methods should be executed, such as the conditions under which they
may be retried. Some of this is exposed via the ``ClientTransport`` as
the ``ClientTransport/retryThrottle`` and
``ClientTransport/config(forMethod:)``.

#### Streams

Both client and server transport protocols use ``RPCStream`` to represent
streams of information. Each RPC can be thought of as having two logical
streams: a request stream where information flows from client to server,
and a response stream where information flows from server to client.
Each ``RPCStream`` has inbound and outbound types corresponding to one end of
each stream.

Inbound types are `AsyncSequence`s (specifically ``RPCAsyncSequence``) of stream
parts, and the outbound types are writer objects (``RPCWriter``) of stream parts.

The stream parts are defined as:
- ``RPCRequestPart``, and
- ``RPCResponsePart``.

A client stream has its outbound type as ``RPCRequestPart`` and its inbound type
as ``RPCResponsePart``. The server stream has its inbound type as ``RPCRequestPart``
and its outbound type as ``RPCResponsePart``.

The ``RPCRequestPart`` is made up of ``Metadata`` and messages (as `[UInt8]`). The
``RPCResponsePart`` extends this to include a final ``Status`` and ``Metadata``.

``Metadata`` contains information about an RPC in the form of a list of
key-value pairs. Keys are strings and values may be strings or binary data (but are
typically strings). Keys for binary values have a "-bin" suffix. The transport
layer may use metadata to propagate transport-specific information about the call to
its peer. The call layer may attach gRPC specific metadata such as call time out
information. Users may also make use of metadata to propagate app specific information
to the remote peer.

Each message part contains the binary data, typically this would be the serialized
representation of a Protocol Buffers message.

The combined ``Status`` and ``Metadata`` part only appears in the ``RPCResponsePart``
and indicates the final outcome of an RPC. It includes a ``Status/Code-swift.struct``
and string describing the final outcome while the ``Metadata`` may contain additional
information about the RPC.

### Call

The "call" layer builds on top the transport layer to map higher level RPCs calls on
to streams. It also implements transport-agnostic functionality, like serialization
and deserialization, retries, hedging, and deadlines.

Serialization is pluggable: you have control over the type of messages used although
most users will use Protocol Buffers. The serialization interface is small, there are
two protocols:
1. ``MessageSerializer`` for serializing messages to bytes, and
2. ``MessageDeserializer`` for deserializing messages from bytes.

The [grpc/grpc-swift-protobuf](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift-protobuf) package
provides support for [SwiftProtobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf) by
implementing serializers and a code generator for the Protocol Buffers
compiler, `protoc`.

#### Interceptors

This layer also provides client and server interceptors allowing you to modify requests
and responses between the caller and the network. These are implemented as
``ClientInterceptor`` and ``ServerInterceptor``, respectively.

As all RPC types are special-cases of bidirectional streaming RPCs, the interceptor
APIs follow the shape of the respective client and server bidirectional streaming APIs.
Naturally, the interceptors APIs are `async`.

Interceptors are registered directly with the ``GRPCClient`` and ``GRPCServer`` and
can either be applied to all RPCs or to specific services.

#### Client

The call layer includes  a concrete ``GRPCClient`` which provides API to execute all
four types of RPC against a ``ClientTransport``. These methods are:

- ``GRPCClient/unary(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:options:onResponse:)``,
- ``GRPCClient/clientStreaming(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:options:onResponse:)``,
- ``GRPCClient/serverStreaming(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:options:onResponse:)``, and
- ``GRPCClient/bidirectionalStreaming(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:options:onResponse:)``.

As lower level methods they require you to pass in a serializer and
deserializer, as well as the descriptor of the method being called. Each method
has a response handling closure to process the response from the server and the
method won't return until the handler has returned. This enforces structured
concurrency.

Most users won't use ``GRPCClient`` to execute RPCs directly, instead they will
use the generated client stubs which wrap the ``GRPCClient``. Users are
responsible for creating the client and running it (which starts and runs the
underlying transport). This is done by calling ``GRPCClient/run()``. The client
can be shutdown gracefully by calling ``GRPCClient/beginGracefulShutdown()``
which will stop new RPCs from starting (by failing them with
``RPCError/Code-swift.struct/unavailable``) but allow existing ones to continue.
Existing work can be stopped more abruptly by cancelling the task where
``GRPCClient/run()`` is executing.

#### Server

``GRPCServer`` is provided by the call layer to host services for a given
transport. Beyond creating the server it has a very limited API surface: it has
a ``GRPCServer/serve()`` method which runs the underlying transport and is the
task from which all accepted streams are run under. Much like the client, you
can initiate graceful shutdown by calling ``GRPCServer/beginGracefulShutdown()``
which will stop new RPCs from being handled but will let existing RPCs run to
completion. Cancelling the task will close the server more abruptly.

### Stub

The stub layer is the layer which most users interact with. It provides service
specific interfaces generated from an interface definition language (IDL) such
as Protobuf. For clients this includes a concrete type per service for invoking
the methods provided by that service. For services this includes a protocol
which the service owner implements with the business logic for their service.

The purpose of the stub layer is to reduce boilerplate: users generate stubs
from a single source of truth to native Swift types to remove errors which would
otherwise arise from writing them manually.

However, the stub layer is optional, users may choose to not use it and
construct clients and services manually. A gRPC proxy, for example, would not
use the stub layer.

#### Server stubs

Users implement services by conforming a type to a generated service `protocol`.
Each service has three protocols generated for it:
1. A "simple" service protocol (_note: this hasn't been implemented yet_),
2. A "regular" service protocol, and
3. A "streaming" service protocol.

The streaming service protocol is the root `protocol`, most users won't need to
implement this protocol directly. It treats each of the four RPC types as a
bidirectional streaming RPC: this allows users to have the most flexibility over
how their RPCs are implemented at the cost of a harder to use API. The following
code shows how the streaming service protocol would look for a service:

```swift
protocol ServiceName.StreamingServiceProtocol {
  func unaryRPC(
    request: StreamingServerRequest<InputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> StreamingServerResponse<OutputName>

  // client-, server-, and bidirectional-streaming are exactly the same as
  // unary.
}
```

An example of where this is useful is when a user wants to implement a unary
method that first sends the initial metadata and then does some other processing
before sending a message.

Many users won't need this much fidelity and will use the "regular" service
protocol which provides APIs which are more appropriate for the type of RPC. The
following code shows how the regular service protocol would look:

```swift
protocol ServiceName.ServiceProtocol: ServiceName.StreamingServiceProtocol {
  func unaryRPC(
    request: ServerRequest<InputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> ServerResponse<OutputName>

  func clientStreamingRPC(
    request: StreamingServerRequest<InputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> ServerResponse<OutputName>

  func serverStreamingRPC(
    request: ServerRequest<InputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> StreamingServerResponse<OutputName>

  func bidirectionalStreamingRPC(
    request: StreamingServerRequest<InputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> StreamingServerResponse<OutputName>
}
```

The conformance to the `StreamingServiceProtocol` is generated an implemented in
terms of the requirements of `ServiceProtocol`. This allows users to use the
higher-level API where possible but can implement the fully-streamed version
per-RPC if necessary.

Some users also won't need access to metadata and will only be interested in the
messages sent and received on an RPC. A higher level "simple" service protocol
is provided for this use case:

```swift
protocol ServiceName.SimpleServiceProtocol: ServiceName.ServiceProtocol {
  func unaryRPC(
    request: InputName,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> OutputName

  func clientStreamingRPC(
    request: RPCAsyncSequence<InputName, any Error>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws -> OutputName

  func serverStreamingRPC(
    request: InputName,
    response: RPCWriter<OutputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws

  func bidirectionalStreamingRPC(
    request: RPCAsyncSequence<InputName, any Error>,
    response: RPCWriter<OutputName>,
    context: ServerContext
  ) async throws
}
```

> Note: the "simple" version hasn't been implemented yet.

Much like the "regular" protocol, the "simple" version refines another service
protocol. In this case it refines the "regular" `ServiceProtocol` for which it
also has a default implementation.

The root of the protocol hierarchy, the `StreamingServiceProtocol`, also
refines the ``RegistrableRPCService`` protocol. This `protocol` has a single
requirement for registering methods with an ``RPCRouter``. A default
implementation of this method is also provided.

#### Client stubs

Generated client code is split into a `protocol` and a concrete `struct`
implementing the `protocol`. An example of the client protocol is:

```swift
protocol ServiceName.ClientProtocol {
  func unaryRPC<R>(
    request: ClientRequest<InputName>,
    serializer: some MessageSerializer<InputName>,
    deserializer: some MessageDeserializer<OutputName>,
    options: CallOptions,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (ClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable

  func clientStreamingRPC<R>(
    request: StreamingClientRequest<InputName>,
    serializer: some MessageSerializer<InputName>,
    deserializer: some MessageDeserializer<OutputName>,
    options: CallOptions,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (ClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable

  func serverStreamingRPC<R>(
    request: ClientRequest<InputName>,
    serializer: some MessageSerializer<InputName>,
    deserializer: some MessageDeserializer<OutputName>,
    options: CallOptions,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (StreamingClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable

  func bidirectionalStreamingRPC<R>(
    request: StreamingClientRequest<InputName>,
    serializer: some MessageSerializer<InputName>,
    deserializer: some MessageDeserializer<OutputName>,
    options: CallOptions,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (StreamingClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable
}
```

Each method takes a request appropriate for its RPC type, a serializer, a
deserializer, a set of options and a handler for processing the response. The
function doesn't return until the response handler has returned and all
resources associated with the RPC have been cleaned up.

An extension to the protocol is also generated which provides an appropriate
serializer and deserializer, defaults the options to `.defaults`, and for RPCs
with a single response message, defaults the closure to returning the response
message:

```swift
extension ServiceName.ClientProtocol {
  func unaryRPC<R>(
    request: ClientRequest<InputName>,
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (ClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R = { try $0.message }
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable {
    // ...
  }

  func clientStreamingRPC<R>(
    request: StreamingClientRequest<InputName>,
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (ClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R = { try $0.message }
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable {
    // ...
  }

  func serverStreamingRPC<R>(
    request: ClientRequest<InputName>,
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (StreamingClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable {
    // ...
  }

  func bidirectionalStreamingRPC<R>(
    request: StreamingClientRequest<InputName>,
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    _ body: @Sendable @escaping (StreamingClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> R
  ) async throws -> R where R: Sendable {
    // ...
  }
}
```

An additional extension is also generated providing even higher level APIs.
These allow the user to avoid creating the request types by creating them on
behalf of the user. For unary RPCs this API distils down to message-in,
message-out, for bidirectional streaming it distils down to two closures, one
for sending messages, one for handling response messages.

```swift
extension ServiceName.ClientProtocol {
  func unaryRPC<Result>(
    _ message: InputName,
    metadata: Metadata = [:],
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    onResponse handleResponse: @Sendable @escaping (ClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> Result = { try $0.message }
  ) async throws -> Result where Result: Sendable {
    // ...
  }

  func clientStreamingRPC<Result>(
    metadata: Metadata = [:],
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    requestProducer: @Sendable @escaping (RPCWriter<InputName>) async throws -> Void,
    onResponse handleResponse: @Sendable @escaping (ClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> Result = { try $0.message }
  ) async throws -> Result where Result: Sendable {
    // ...
  }

  func serverStreamingRPC<Result>(
    _ message: InputName,
    metadata: Metadata = [:],
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    onResponse handleResponse: @Sendable @escaping (StreamingClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> Result
  ) async throws -> Result where Result: Sendable {
    // ...
  }

  func bidirectionalStreamingRPC<Result>(
    metadata: Metadata = [:],
    options: CallOptions = .defaults,
    requestProducer: @Sendable @escaping (RPCWriter<InputName>) async throws -> Void,
    onResponse handleResponse: @Sendable @escaping (StreamingClientResponse<OutputName>) async throws -> Result
  ) async throws -> Result where Result: Sendable {
    // ...
  }
}
```
