/// A throttle used to rate-limit retries and hedging attempts.
///
/// gRPC prevents servers from being overloaded by retries and hedging by using a token-based
/// throttling mechanism at the transport level.
///
/// Each client transport maintains a throttle for the server it is connected to and gRPC records
/// successful and failed RPC attempts. Successful attempts increment the number of tokens
/// by ``tokenRatio`` and failed attempts decrement the available tokens by one. In the context
/// of throttling, a failed attempt is one where the server terminates the RPC with a status code
/// which is retryable or non fatal (as defined by ``RetryPolicy/retryableStatusCodes`` and
/// ``HedgingPolicy/nonFatalStatusCodes``) or when the client receives a pushback response from
/// the server.
///
/// See also [gRFC A6: client retries](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md).
