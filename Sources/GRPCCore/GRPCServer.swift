internal import Atomics

/// A gRPC server.
///
/// The server accepts connections from clients and listens on each connection for new streams
/// which are initiated by the client. Each stream maps to a single RPC. The server routes accepted
/// streams to a service to handle the RPC or rejects them with an appropriate error if no service
/// can handle the RPC.
///
/// A ``GRPCServer`` listens with a specific transport implementation (for example, HTTP/2 or in-process),
/// and routes requests from the transport to the service instance. You can also use "interceptors",
/// to implement cross-cutting logic which apply to all accepted RPCs. Example uses of interceptors
/// include request filtering, authentication, and logging. Once requests have been intercepted
/// they are passed to a handler which in turn returns a response to send back to the client.
///
/// ## Creating and configuring a server
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to create and configure a server.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create and an in-process transport.
/// let inProcessTransport = InProcessServerTransport()
///
/// // Create the 'Greeter' and 'Echo' services.
/// let greeter = GreeterService()
/// let echo = EchoService()
///
/// // Create an interceptor.
/// let statsRecorder = StatsRecordingServerInterceptors()
///
/// // Finally create the server.
/// let server = GRPCServer(
///   transport: inProcessTransport,
///   services: [greeter, echo],
///   interceptors: [statsRecorder]
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Starting and stopping the server
///
/// Once you have configured the server call ``run()`` to start it. Calling ``run()`` starts the server's
/// transport too. A ``RuntimeError`` is thrown if the transport can't be started or encounters some other
/// runtime error.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Start running the server.
/// try await server.run()
/// ```
///
/// The ``run()`` method won't return until the server has finished handling all requests. You can
/// signal to the server that it should stop accepting new requests by calling ``stopListening()``.
/// This allows the server to drain existing requests gracefully. To stop the server more abruptly
/// you can cancel the task running your server. If your application requires additional resources
/// that need their lifecycles managed you should consider using [Swift Service
/// Lifecycle](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-service-lifecycle).
