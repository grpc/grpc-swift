import Atomics

/// A gRPC client.
///
/// A ``GRPCClient`` communicates to a server via a ``ClientTransport``.
///
/// You can start RPCs to the server by calling the corresponding method:
/// - ``unary(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:handler:)``
/// - ``clientStreaming(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:handler:)``
/// - ``serverStreaming(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:handler:)``
/// - ``bidirectionalStreaming(request:descriptor:serializer:deserializer:handler:)``
///
/// However, in most cases you should prefer wrapping the ``GRPCClient`` with a generated stub.
///
/// You can set ``ServiceConfig``s on this client to override whatever configurations have been
/// set on the given transport. You can also use ``ClientInterceptor``s to implement cross-cutting
/// logic which apply to all RPCs. Example uses of interceptors include authentication and logging.
///
/// ## Creating and configuring a client
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to create and configure a client.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a configuration object for the client and override the timeout for the 'Get' method on
/// // the 'echo.Echo' service. This configuration takes precedence over any set by the transport.
/// var configuration = GRPCClient.Configuration()
/// configuration.service.override = ServiceConfig(
///   methodConfig: [
///     MethodConfig(
///       names: [
///         MethodConfig.Name(service: "echo.Echo", method: "Get")
///       ],
///       timeout: .seconds(5)
///     )
///   ]
/// )
///
/// // Configure a fallback timeout for all RPCs (indicated by an empty service and method name) if
/// // no configuration is provided in the overrides or by the transport.
/// configuration.service.defaults = ServiceConfig(
///   methodConfig: [
///     MethodConfig(
///       names: [
///         MethodConfig.Name(service: "", method: "")
///       ],
///       timeout: .seconds(10)
///     )
///   ]
/// )
///
/// // Finally create a transport and instantiate the client, adding an interceptor.
/// let inProcessServerTransport = InProcessServerTransport()
/// let inProcessClientTransport = InProcessClientTransport(serverTransport: inProcessServerTransport)
///
/// let client = GRPCClient(
///   transport: inProcessClientTransport,
///   interceptors: [StatsRecordingClientInterceptor()],
///   configuration: configuration
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Starting and stopping the client
///
/// Once you have configured the client, call ``run()`` to start it. Calling ``run()`` instructs the
/// transport to start connecting to the server.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Start running the client. 'run()' must be running while RPCs are execute so it's executed in
/// // a task group.
/// try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group in
///   group.addTask {
///     try await client.run()
///   }
///
///   // Execute a request against the "echo.Echo" service.
///   try await client.unary(
///     request: ClientRequest.Single<[UInt8]>(message: [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 33]),
///     descriptor: MethodDescriptor(service: "echo.Echo", method: "Get"),
///     serializer: IdentitySerializer(),
///     deserializer: IdentityDeserializer(),
///   ) { response in
///     print(response.message)
///   }
///
///   // The RPC has completed, close the client.
///   client.close()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The ``run()`` method won't return until the client has finished handling all requests. You can
/// signal to the client that it should stop creating new request streams by calling ``close()``.
/// This gives the client enough time to drain any requests already in flight. To stop the client
/// more abruptly you can cancel the task running your client. If your application requires
/// additional resources that need their lifecycles managed you should consider using [Swift Service
/// Lifecycle](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-service-lifecycle).
