/// This class is the glue between a `NIO.Channel` and the `ClientInterceptorPipeline`. In fact
/// this object owns the interceptor pipeline and is also a `ChannelHandler`. The caller has very
/// little API to use on this class: they may configure the transport by adding it to a
/// `NIO.ChannelPipeline` with `configure(_:)`, send request parts via `send(_:promise:)` and
/// attempt to cancel the RPC with `cancel(promise:)`. Response parts – after traversing the
/// interceptor pipeline – are emitted to the `onResponsePart` callback supplied to the initializer.
///
/// In most instances the glue code is simple: transformations are applied to the request and
/// response types used by the interceptor pipeline and the `NIO.Channel`. In addition, the
/// transport keeps track of the state of the call and the `Channel`, taking appropriate action
/// when these change. This includes buffering request parts from the interceptor pipeline until
/// the `NIO.Channel` becomes active.
