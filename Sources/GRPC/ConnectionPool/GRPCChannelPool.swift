public enum GRPCChannelPool {
  /// Make a new ``GRPCChannel`` on which calls may be made to gRPC services.
  ///
  /// The channel is backed by one connection pool per event loop, each of which may make multiple
  /// connections to the given target. The size of the connection pool, and therefore the maximum
  /// number of connections it may create at a given time is determined by the number of event loops
  /// in the provided `EventLoopGroup` and the value of
  /// ``GRPCChannelPool/Configuration/ConnectionPool-swift.struct/connectionsPerEventLoop``.
  ///
  /// The event loop and therefore connection chosen for a call is determined by
  /// ``CallOptions/eventLoopPreference-swift.property``. If the `indifferent` preference is used
  /// then the least-used event loop is chosen and a connection on that event loop will be selected.
  /// If an `exact` preference is used then a connection on that event loop will be chosen provided
  /// the given event loop belongs to the `EventLoopGroup` used to create this ``GRPCChannel``.
  ///
  /// Each connection in the pool is initially idle, and no connections will be established until
  /// a call is made. The pool also closes connections after they have been inactive (i.e. are not
  /// being used for calls) for some period of time. This is determined by
  /// ``GRPCChannelPool/Configuration/idleTimeout``.
  ///
  /// > Important: The values of `transportSecurity` and `eventLoopGroup` **must** be compatible.
  /// >
  /// >   For ``GRPCChannelPool/Configuration/TransportSecurity-swift.struct/tls(_:)`` the allowed
  /// >   `EventLoopGroup`s depends on the value of ``GRPCTLSConfiguration``. If a TLS configuration
  /// >   is known ahead of time, ``PlatformSupport/makeEventLoopGroup(compatibleWith:loopCount:)``
  /// >   may be used to construct a compatible `EventLoopGroup`.
  /// >
  /// >   If the `EventLoopGroup` is known ahead of time then a default TLS configuration may be
  /// >   constructed with ``GRPCTLSConfiguration/makeClientDefault(compatibleWith:)``.
  /// >
  /// >   For ``GRPCChannelPool/Configuration/TransportSecurity-swift.struct/plaintext`` transport
  /// >   security both `MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup` and `NIOTSEventLoopGroup` (and `EventLoop`s
  /// >   from either) may be used.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - target: The target to connect to.
  ///   - transportSecurity: Transport layer security for connections.
  ///   - eventLoopGroup: The `EventLoopGroup` to run connections on.
  ///   - configure: A closure which may be used to modify defaulted configuration before
  ///        constructing the ``GRPCChannel``.
  /// - Throws: If it is not possible to construct an SSL context. This will never happen when
  ///     using the ``GRPCChannelPool/Configuration/TransportSecurity-swift.struct/plaintext``
  ///     transport security.
  /// - Returns: A ``GRPCChannel``.
