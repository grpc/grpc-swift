# Echo, a gRPC Sample App

This directory contains a simple echo server that demonstrates all four gRPC API
styles (Unary, Server Streaming, Client Streaming, and Bidirectional Streaming)
using the gRPC Swift.

There are three subdirectories:
* `Model` containing the service and model definitions and generated code,
* `Implementation` containing the server implementation of the generated model,
* `Runtime` containing a CLI for the server and client.
