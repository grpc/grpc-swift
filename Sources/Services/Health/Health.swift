import GRPCCore

/// ``Health`` is gRPCâ€™s mechanism for checking whether a server is able to handle RPCs. Its semantics are documented in
/// https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md.
///
/// `Health` initializes a new ``Health/Service-swift.struct`` and ``Health/Provider-swift.struct``.
/// - `Health.Service` implements the Health service from the `grpc.health.v1` package and can be registered with a server
/// like any other service.
/// - `Health.Provider` provides status updates to `Health.Service`. `Health.Service` doesn't know about the other
/// services running on a server so it must be provided with status updates via `Health.Provider`. To make specifying the service
/// being updated easier, the generated code for services includes an extension to `ServiceDescriptor`.
///
/// The following shows an example of initializing a Health service and updating the status of the `Foo` service in the `bar` package.
///
/// ```swift
/// let health = Health()
/// let server = GRPCServer(
///   transport: transport,
///   services: [health.service, FooService()]
/// )
///
/// health.provider.updateStatus(
///   .serving,
///   forService: .bar_Foo
/// )
/// ```
