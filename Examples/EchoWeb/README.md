# Echo gRPC-Web Sample App

The Echo gRPC-Web is a node project that creates a website that
connects to a Swift gRPC NIO server to display messages. To build
it, just run `make` inside this directory, and then open the
`index.html` file in a web browser. Remember to start the Echo
service by executing `swift run EchoNIO serve` before opening
`index.html` in the browser.

The proto files were generated by invoking `protoc` with the
`protoc-gen-grpc-web` plugin as described
[here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/tree/master/net/grpc/gateway/examples/helloworld#generate-protobuf-messages-and-client-service-stub).

## Dependencies

You'll need to install `npm` in order to compile the Javascript
code.
