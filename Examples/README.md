# Examples

To build the Xcode examples, you will need to add the `SwiftGRPC` project (and possibly the `SwiftProtobuf` project from https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf as well) to the corresponding Xcode projects. This is explained in more detail in the individual directories' `README.md` files.

## Swift gRPC generated code examples

[Echo](Echo)
The Echo sample demonstrates a simple echo service with nonstreaming and streaming APIS.
It can be run with or without TLS. Swift clients and servers are built in a Mac app 
and in a command-line tool that is built with the Swift Package Manager. An 
interoperable client and server is in the [Echo/Go](Echo/Go) directory. 

The Echo sample uses a client and server interface generated by the Swift gRPC plugin
for protoc.

## Google API examples

Samples that call Google gRPC APIs are in the [Google](Google) directory.

## Low-level demonstrations

[Simple](Simple)
The Simple sample demonstrates the low-level gRPC APIs with clients and servers
that can be built with Xcode or the Swift Package Manager.
