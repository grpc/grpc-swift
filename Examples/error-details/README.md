# Detailed Error

This example demonstrates how to create and unpack detailed errors.

## Overview

A command line tool that demonstrates how a detailed error can be thrown by a
service and unpacked and inspected by a client. The detailed error model is
described in more detailed in the [gRPC Error
Guide](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/error/) and is made available via the
[grpc-swift-protobuf](https://github.com/grpc-swift-protobuf) package.

## Prerequisites

You must have the Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`) installed. You can find
the instructions for doing this in the [gRPC Swift Protobuf documentation][0].
The `swift` commands below are all prefixed with `PROTOC_PATH=$(which protoc)`,
this is to let the build system know where `protoc` is located so that it can
generate stubs for you. You can read more about it in the [gRPC Swift Protobuf
documentation][1].

## Usage

Build and run the example using the CLI:

```console
$ PROTOC_PATH=$(which protoc) swift run
Error code: resourceExhausted
Error message: The greeter has temporarily run out of greetings.
Error details:
- Localized message (en-GB): Out of enthusiasm. The greeter is having a cup of tea, try again after that.
- Localized message (en-US): Out of enthusiasm. The greeter is taking a coffee break, try again later.
